####Form methods
    Formal methods can be part of the solution if imprecise designs and implementations that deviate from product
    specifications or design intentions are the causes for faults. Formal methods can prevent injection of certain 
    defects into the software system. 
    
    Formal methods cannot guarantee perfection for software, but only assure it with respect to the formal  
    specifications verified or the properties checked. In general, formal methods are suitable to stable product
    development and market environments, where product requirements can be captured into formal specifications and
    remain fairly stable thereafter to allow for later refinements and verifications. 
    
####Model Checking
    Model checking is an approach that automatically or algorithmically checks certain properties for some software systems. 
* Based upon the proposition temporal logic specification language;
* Authentication system indicates the encoding method is the state machine ;
* Authentication algorithm for intelligent search of the state space to determine specification is true or false;
* If the specification is not implemented, the model test can give a counterexample.

    It need to consider increasing efficiency and reducing memory space requirements, in addition, studies to reduce
    the needto verify the nature of the model itself or complexity, there are different types of main methods abstract
    slicing model decomposition, validation nature.
