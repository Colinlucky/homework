1.  what I have learn from this course
--------------

From this course through about 8 weeks,I have learnt a lot,such as what is the software quality assurance,and how to ensure quality of the software.Software Quality Assurance is to establish a set of planned, systematic method, and guarantee to the management to formulate the standards, procedures, practices and methods to be used by allprojects.The purpose of Software quality Assurance make the software process visible for managers.It through to the software products and activities for review and audit to verify that the software is up to standard.Besides,we learn the software quality assurance always focus on testing,thus I also have learnt a lot about the testing,the testing can guarantee the quality of the software, and constantly improve the performance of software,so I think it is important to learn how to test software.

2.  how to ensure the quality of a software system
----------------
As to this question,I think a good architecture is one of main factors to ensure the quality of a software ststem,on the other hand,the testing must be considered.Software testing is any activity aimed at evaluating an attribute or capability of a program or system and determining that it meets its required results.Testing is more than just debugging. The purpose of testing can be quality assurance, verification and validation, or reliability estimation. Testing can be used as a generic metric as well. Correctness testing and reliability testing are two major areas of testing. Software testing is a trade-off between budget, time and quality. In my opinion,six functional tests to ensure software quality:
#####*  Ensure every line of code executes properly with Unit Testing.
Unit testing is the process of testing each unit of code in a single component. This form of testing is carried out by the developer as the component is being developed. The developer is responsible for ensuring that each detail of the implementation is logically correct. 
#####*  Ensure every function produces its expected outcome with Functional Testing.
Functional testing addresses concerns surrounding the correct implementation of functional requirements. Commonly referred to as black box testing, this type of testing requires no knowledge of the underlying implementation.
Functional test suites are created from requirement use cases, with each scenario becoming a functional test. As a component is implemented, the respective functional test is applied to it after it has been unit tested.For many projects, it is unreasonable to test every functional aspect of the software. Instead, define functional testing goals that are appropriate for the project. Prioritize critical and widely used functions and include other functions as time and resources permit.For detailed information on how to correctly develop use cases to support functional testing, refer to the Info-Tech Advisor research note, "Use Cases: Steer Clear of the Pitfalls."
#####*  Ensure all functions combine to deliver the desired business result with System Testing. 
System testing executes end-to-end functional tests that cross software units, helping to realize the goal of ensuring that components combine to deliver the desired business result. In defining the project's system testing goals, focus on those scenarios that require critical units to integrate.
#####*  Ensure new changes did not adversely affect other parts of the system with Regression Testing. 
Regression testing ensures code modifications have not inadvertently introduced bugs into the system or changed existing functionality. Goals for regression testing should include plans from the original unit, as well as functional and system tests phases to demonstrate that existing functionality behaves as intended.
#####*  Ensure the system integrates with and does not adversely affect other enterprise systems with System Integration Testing. 
System integration testing is a process that assesses the software's interoperability and cooperation with other applications. Define testing goals that will exercise required communication. (It is fruitless to test interaction between systems that will not collaborate once the developed system is installed.) This is done using process flows that encapsulate the entire system.
